<H2>What Is the OpenFlight API?</H2><P>
The <I>OpenFlight API</I> is a set of C header files and libraries that provides a 
programming interface to Creator and the OpenFlight database format. The API is divided 
conceptually into four levels: Read, Write, Extensions, and Tools. This document contains 
the reference pages for all levels of the OpenFlight API.  All levels of the API are available 
on the Windows platform. Levels 1, 2 and 3 are available on the Linux platform.<P>
<I>OpenFlight Script</I> is a cross-platform Python Language binding to the C Language OpenFlight API. 
Based on the Python scripting language, OpenFlight Script provides nearly all the functionality of 
the OpenFlight API. If you understand the concepts of the OpenFlight API, you 
will find programming in either the C Language API or OpenFlight Script very similar.<P>
You can use OpenFlight Script to do nearly everything you could otherwise do with the C Language API. 
In general, OpenFlight Script applications run more slowly than comparable tools written 
using the C Language API, so if performance is an issue, consider using the C Language API.<P>
<H2>Audience</H2><P>
This document is written for modelers and programmers who want to write stand-alone applications, 
plug-ins, or scripts using OpenFlight API interfaces.  To use the OpenFlight API, 
and this document, you should be comfortable with the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) C programming language and have some understanding of 3D modeling.  Familiarity 
with Presagis modeling tools and the OpenFlight format is helpful, but is not required.<P>
<H2>About This Document</H2><P>
This document provides detailed information on functions included in the OpenFlight API. 
This document is intended to be used in conjunction with the <I>OpenFlight API Developer Guide</I>.<P>
<H2>What can I distribute to others?</H2><P>
Users may develop and share their own content, code, and plug-ins freely at their own 
discretion. The OpenFlight API DLLs used by the applications and plug-ins you develop 
may only be distributed with a signed <I>Amendment to Software License Agreement</I>. 
This agreement includes a description of the intended use of the files, and outlines 
the usage rights.  This agreement (OpenFlight_API_Amendment_to_SLA_Presagis_051109.pdf) 
is included in the documentation folder of the OpenFlight API distribution or can be obtained 
by contacting Presagis for more information e-mail: openflight@presagis.com. Under no 
circumstances are you allowed to distribute the debug version of the OpenFlight 
API DLLs.<P>
<H2>What is not allowed?</H2><P>
Users of the OpenFlight API are not allowed under any circumstances to redistribute 
the header files, sample code, import libraries (.lib files), and documentation (including 
reference document, tutorials and any developers guides associated with the OpenFlight API 
and Presagis Creator software product).<P>
